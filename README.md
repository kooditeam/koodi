Project made primarily during the course *Web server programming practical work* (*Web-palvelinohjelmoinnin harjoitusty√∂*) in fall 2015 in the University of Helsinki, later on continued to possibly get it to use for students at the department of computer science.


The app is about code reading exercises.
